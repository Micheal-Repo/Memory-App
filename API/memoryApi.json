This \"clamps\" the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the voltage clamp to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in charge to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential.[2] Cell membranes of excitable cells contain many different kinds of ion channels, some of which are voltage-gated. The voltage clamp allows the membrane voltage to be manipulated independently of the ionic currents, allowing the current–voltage relationships of membrane channels to be studied.[3]\n\nThe voltage clamp operates by negative feedback. The membrane potential amplifier measures membrane voltage and sends output to the feedback amplifier; this subtracts the membrane voltage from the command voltage, which it receives from the signal generator. This signal is amplified and output is sent into the axon via the current-passing electrode.",

These branches can occur at different positions along the carbon backbone. BCFAs are not as common as straight-chain fatty acids but are found in some biological organisms. Here are a few examples of branched-chain fatty acids:\n\n1. **Isovaleric Acid:** Isovaleric acid is a branched-chain fatty acid with a single methyl group on the carbon chain. It has a branched structure and is found in trace amounts in some dairy products. It contributes to the distinctive odor of sweaty feet.\n\n2. **Isobutyric Acid:** Isobutyric acid is another branched-chain fatty acid with a methyl group branching off the carbon chain. It's found in some cheeses and is partly responsible for their aroma.\n\n3. **Phytanic Acid:** Phytanic acid is a branched-chain fatty acid with multiple methyl groups along its carbon chain. It's derived from phytol, a component of chlorophyll, and is found in the fat of ruminant animals. Accumulation of phytanic acid can lead to a metabolic disorder known as Refsum disease.\n\n4. **Tuberculostearic Acid:** Tuberculostearic acid is a branched-chain fatty acid with a unique structure. It is produced by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is associated with the cell wall of this pathogen.\n\nThese branched-chain fatty acids have distinct chemical structures and can have specific functions in the organisms that produce or encounter them.",

HDL helps rid your body of excess cholesterol so it’s less likely to end up in your arteries.\n\nLDL is called “bad cholesterol” because it takes cholesterol to your arteries, where it can collect in your artery walls. Too much cholesterol in your arteries may lead to a buildup of plaque known as atherosclerosis. This can increase the risk of blood clots in your arteries.\n\nIf a blood clot breaks away and blocks an artery in your heart or brain, you may have a stroke or heart attack.\n\nPlaque buildup may also reduce blood flow and oxygen to major organs.
